    <p> This was one of my favorite classes at UC Berkeley. Besides the controls theory taught in class, it also included a lab section which was almost magical. </p>

    <p> First lab project we had was to build a closed-loop controller to perform magnetic levitation on electromagnets to be able to levitate metal objects. This is a video of the controller working (video credits to Emily).</p>

    <p> Second project only got more exciting. Our goal was to program a PID controller to move a cart with a hinged pendulum such that the pendulum is maintained upright. Here is the video of it working (Again credits to Emily).</p>
