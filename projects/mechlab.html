    <p> This was a semester long project with the course EE 192 (Mechatronics Design Lab) at UC Berkeley. The project consisted on designing and building an 
        autonomous racing car that is able to follow a racing track marked with tape. The semester culminated with a national competition at UC Davis (NATCAR),
        where my team won first place with an average speed of 9.06 feet/s.

    <p> Our project made use of a line array camera for detecting the tape on the racing track</p>

    <p> The motor controller board was custom built which integrates a double H-bridge and boost converters to provide maximum power to the
        motors efficiently.

    <p> We used a Freescale FRDM-KL25Z microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M0) to do the sensor data filtering and real time control of the car.</p>
