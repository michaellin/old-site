    <h2 class="team-members"> Michael Lin, Kenneth Lin</h2>
    <h2 class="project-info"> UC Berkeley, Fall 2012 </h2>
    <p> The goal of the hackathon was to create a Rube Goldberg machine integrating as many APIs as possible (if you dont know what a RG machine is see <a href="https://www.rubegoldberg.com/about/"> this</a>). 
    </p>
    <p>Our Rube Goldberg began by running a python script in my Macbook that would send a serial message to an Arduino. The Arduino would then control the servo to shoot the rubber band gun and trigger the chain of dominoes. The last domino would fall on a mouse hitting a left click. This would trigger a Twilio script in Kenneth's laptop and send a text to a cellphone on the side. The cellhpone would have an Android app open and listening for a call using Google Voicemail. Once it gets it it would play a song through the speakers and post a celebration message on Facebook using Facebook API.
