    <p> We decided to work on two concurrent project in the time-frame of 24 hours. One project consisted on 
    building a Mind-controlled RC car. We used an off-the shelf EEG headset (Neurosky Mindset) detect eye blinking
    movements as well as the level of concentration of the wearer. These two inputs were used to steer and speed up
    the car respectively.

    <p> For the second project, we built an IR beacon following RC car. We mounted the RC car with a Nintendo Wiimote and used a Wii infrared sensor bar mounted on a moving target to control the RC car to follow the target. To make the project more exciting, we installed a two link manipulator powered by hobby servos to simulate the motion of a scorpion stinger. The stinger was programmed to sting if the target is within a threshold distance.
