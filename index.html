                I am currently a M.S. student in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University. I obtained my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science 
            at the University of California, Berkeley.

               My focus in undergraduate was on mechatronics design. Some projects I have worked on include autonomous racing car, 
            IR pulse oximeter and an inertial measurement system. Most of the <a href="{{ "/projects.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"> other projects</a> I've worked on come from fun weekends
            in hackathons with friends.
