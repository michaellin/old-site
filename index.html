               My focus in undergraduate was on mechatronics design. Some projects I have worked on include autonomous racing car, 
            IR pulse oximeter and some other fun school projects. Most of the <a href="{{ "/projects.html/#hackathons" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"> other projects</a> I've worked on come from going to hackathons with friends.
